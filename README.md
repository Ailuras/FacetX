# DocsBot

A lightweight, dark-themed project dashboard for research and engineering teams. DocsBot serves a single-page web UI from plain JavaScript data files — no build step, no database, just structured project docs.

## Features

- **Four-section dashboard**: Recent Tasks, Research, Engineering, Notes
- **Dark theme**: Gold-accented UI inspired by academic paper aesthetics
- **Zero build**: Data is plain `.js` files; frontend is vanilla JS + CSS
- **Open folder**: Point DocsBot at any project folder — it auto-detects the `docs/` subdirectory
- **Note modal**: Click any note card to read full HTML content inline
- **Cross-references**: Research directions link to engineering tasks via `serves` / `depends_on`

## Quick Start

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Ailuras/DocsBot
cd DocsBot
uv sync

# Start the server
uv run docsbot serve

# Open http://127.0.0.1:8766
# Then enter a project folder path in the browser to load it
```

## Opening a Project

DocsBot can load any project folder that contains a `data/meta.js` file. If the folder has a `docs/` subdirectory, DocsBot auto-detects it.

When no project is configured, the browser shows a prompt — paste in the absolute path to your project folder and click **打开**.

Registered paths are persisted in `external_projects.json` so they survive server restarts.

## Managed Projects

You can also keep projects inside the repo under `projects/`:

```bash
# Create a new managed project
uv run docsbot init my-project

# Check server status and project list
uv run docsbot status
```

Each project uses this layout:

```
projects/my-project/
  data/
    meta.js       -- project identity and navigation
    research.js   -- research directions (R1, R2, ...)
    backlog.js    -- engineering tasks (P0-01, P1-02, ...)
    roadmap.js    -- weekly planning
    changelog.js  -- commit history
    notes.js      -- note index
  notes/
    *.html        -- individual notes
```

All `.js` files in `data/` assign to `window.AUGUR_*` globals. The frontend evaluates them in a sandbox and renders the dashboard.

## Example Project

An example project is included in `examples/demo/`. If no projects are configured, the server falls back to the example automatically.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `uv run docsbot serve` | Start the web server (default port 8766) |
| `uv run docsbot serve --stop` | Stop the running server |
| `uv run docsbot serve --daemon` | Run in background |
| `uv run docsbot status` | Show server status and project list |
| `uv run docsbot init NAME` | Create a new managed project |
| `uv run docsbot lint` | Run syntax check on data files |

## Development

```bash
uv sync --dev        # install with dev dependencies (pytest, ruff)
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check src/
```
